# Hello-World
I am have been creating items for war gaming and table top games for about a year not or a laser cutter and have just started  tinkering on a 3d printer
I am based in the North-East of England, between Newcastle and Sunderland and have been working closely with the guys at the Worhamma club and the Gaming Cafe Flipside both of which are based in Sunderland.
Most of the things I have created have been at the request of the members of the club
